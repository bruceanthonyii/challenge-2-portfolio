# challenge-2-portfolio

This is my portfolio page that I loosly modeled from the mocck up in canvas. 

There are make note that there are no project links because I am still a rookie and have no personal projects to showcase. The links do work bu they will just send you back to the top of the screen. Contact links fucntion alike.


Here is the link to the site
